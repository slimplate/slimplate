title: Slimplate NextJS
---

You can use Slimplate with nextjs, and we have some fairly advanced tools and libraries that make it very easy.

You can quickly setup a pre-configuured demo-site with this command, just follow the prompts:

```
npm init slimplate mysite
```

# DIY

If you want to do the steps yourtself, more manually, here is a basic path to a static site:

1. Setup a backend, following the directions for [vercelghserver](https://github.com/slimplate/vercelghserver) or [cfghserver](cfghserver)
2. [incorporate slimplate into your site](config/next)
3. Push your site to Github
4. Start editing!
